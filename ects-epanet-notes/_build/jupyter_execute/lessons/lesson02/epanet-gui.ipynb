    "### Example 1\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple model to consider is a single pipe connecting two reservoirs.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **problem statement** might be something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "> A 5-foot diameter, enamel coated, steel pipe carries 60oF water at a dis-\n",
    "charge of 295 cubic-feet per second (cfs). Using the Moody chart, estimate\n",
    "the head loss in a 10,000 foot length of this pipe.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{note}\n",
    "This example is verbatim from the references in the previous section, here the examples are presented using the freeswmm interface.  Be aware that the files are pre-placed, so one could simply open and go without building a model.\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "In EPANET we will start the program, build a tank-pipe system and find the head\n",
    "loss in a 10,000 foot length of the pipe. The program will compute the friction factor\n",
    "for us (and we can check on the Moody chart if we wish).\n",
    "\n",
    "The main trick in EPANET is going to be the friction coefficient, in the EPANET\n",
    "manual on page 30 and 31, the author indicates that the program expects a roughness\n",
    "coefficient based on the head loss equation. The units of the roughness coefficient for\n",
    "a steel pipe are $0.15 \\times 10^{-3}$ feet. On page 71 of the user manual the author states\n",
    "that roughness coefficients are in millifeet (millimeters) when the Darcy-Weisbach\n",
    "head loss model is used. So keeping that in mind we proceed with the example.\n",

    "Figure xx is a screen capture of the EPANET program after connecting in freeswmm.\n",

    "The program starts as a blank slate and we will select a reservoir and a node from\n",

    "\n",
    "Failure to set correct units for your problem are sometimes hard to detect\n",
    "(if the model runs), so best to make it a habit to set defaults for all new projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we add the reservoir and the node. Figure 41 is a screen capture after the reservoir and node are placed.  \n",
    "\n",

    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "We will specify a total head at the reservoir (value is unimportant as long as it is big enough to overcome the head loss and not result in a\n",
    "negative pressure at the node. We will specify the demand at the node equal to the\n",
    "desired \n",
    "flow in the pipe. \n",

    "\n",
    "The sense of flow in this example is from reservoir to node, but if we had it backwards we could either accept a negative flow in the pipe, or right-click the pipe and reverse the start and end node connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can go back to each hydraulic element in the model and edit the properties.\n",
    "We supply pipe properties (diameter, length, roughness height) as in Figure 45. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](./ex1/ex1ss5.png)\n",

    "We supply the reservoir total head as in Figure 47.\n",

    "We set the demand node elevation and the actual desired flow rate as in Figure 49. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](./ex1/ex1ss7.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The program is now ready to run, next step would be to save the input file.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{note}\n",
    "I will save an input file and a \"network\" file.  The network file can be run using a command-line version or using the programmers toolkit.  We will use this toolkit later on in the short course\n",

A successful run means the program found an answer to the problem you provided - whether it is the correct answer to your problem requires the engineer to interpret results and decide if they make sense. \n",
    "\n",
    "The more common conceptualization errors are incorrect units and head loss equation for the supplied roughness values, missed connections, and forgetting demand somewhere.\n",
    "With practice these kind of errors are straightforward to detect. In the present\n",
    "example we select the pipe and the solution values are reported at the bottom of a dialog box.\n",
    "\n",

    "The total head at the demnad node is about 28 feet, so the head loss plus remaining\n",
    "head at the node is equal to the 100 feet of head at the reservoir, the anticipated\n",
    "result.\n",
    "The computed friction factor is 0.010, which we could check against the Moody chart\n",

    "### Example 2\n",
    "\n",
    "This example represents the situation where the total head is known at two points on a pipeline, and one wishes to determine the flow rate (or specify a flow rate and solve for a pipe diameter). Like the prior example it is contrived, but follows the same general modeling process.\n",
    "\n",
    "As in the prior example, we will use EPANET to solve a problem we have already solved by hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **problem statement** is:\n",

    "of a cast-iron pipe needed to carry 60oF water at a discharge of 10 cubic-\n",
    "feet per second (cfs) between two reservoirs 2 miles apart. The elevation\n",

    "> A sketch of the situation is ![](./ex2/EX2.bmp)\n",

    "Page 31 of the EPANET manual suggests that the roughness height for cast iron is\n",

    "1. Start EPANET\n",

    "4. Select the node tool, put a node on the map. EPANET needs one node!\n",

    "6. Set the total head each reservoir.\n",
    "7. Set the pipe length and roughness height in the 2 mile pipe.\n",
    "8. Guess a diameter.\n",
    "9. Save the input file.\n",
    "10. Run the program. Query the pipe and find the computed flow. If the flow is too large reduce the pipe diameter, if too small increase the pipe diameter. Stop when within a few percent of the desired flow rate. Use commercially available diameters in the trial-and-error process, so exact match is not anticipated.\n",
