    "# 2.4 EPANET Programmers Toolkit\n",
    "\n",
    "The EPANET Programmer's Toolkit is a software applications programming interface (API) designed to facilitate the analysis and simulation of water distribution networks. Developed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), EPANET is widely recognized as a comprehensive and reliable hydraulic and water quality modeling tool. The EPANET Programmer's Toolkit offers engineers and researchers the ability to harness the full potential of EPANET's capabilities, providing a platform for advanced water network analysis and optimization, directly accessing the computation engine without requiring the Graphical User Interface (GUI), or running the program in a batch mode with a prebuilt input file."

    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The EPANET Programmer's Toolkit provides essential functions that allow users to manipulate EPANET models and retrieve critical information for hydraulic and water quality analysis. With the toolkit, users can access network data such as pipe and node properties, demand patterns, and control settings. This information can be modified or updated programmatically, enabling engineers to conduct what-if scenarios, optimize system design, and assess the impact of various operational strategies on network performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the toolkit's key features is its ability to perform hydraulic and water quality simulations. Users can dynamically simulate water flow and pressure behavior in the network, enabling accurate prediction of system performance under different operating conditions. Moreover, the toolkit allows for the analysis of water quality parameters, such as chlorine concentration and contaminant transport, aiding in the evaluation of water safety and compliance with regulatory standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "The EPANET Programmer's Toolkit empowers water industry professionals to tackle complex water network challenges with greater efficiency and accuracy. By leveraging its capabilities, engineers can optimize pipe sizing, evaluate system resilience, and assess the impact of infrastructure changes on network performance. The toolkit's ability to perform advanced simulations and analysis aids in the identification of potential issues, facilitating proactive decision-making and improving overall water network management. Furthermore, the EPANET Programmer's Toolkit plays a crucial role in supporting research and innovation in the field of water distribution system analysis, fostering the development of new methodologies and solutions to address emerging challenges in water management.\n",

    "## Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary purpose of the EPANET Programmer's Toolkit is to enhance the functionality of EPANET and enable users to access its full potential in water distribution network analysis. The Toolkit serves as an **interface** that allows engineers and researchers to programmatically access and manipulate EPANET models, retrieve critical information, and perform hydraulic and water quality simulations without having to access the model through the Graphical User Interface (GUI). By providing essential modeling access functions, integration capabilities, and customization options, the toolkit enables analysts to conduct in-depth analysis, optimize system design, and evaluate the performance of water networks under various operational conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The EPANET Programmer's Toolkit supports integration with various programming languages, including C, C++, and Python, making it end-user adaptable to different software development environments. This flexibility allows engineers and researchers to leverage their preferred programming languages and frameworks, facilitating seamless integration with existing tools and workflows. Additionally, the toolkit's extensive Application Programming Interface (API) documentation and code examples provide valuable resources for developers, enabling them to extend EPANET's functionality and customize the software to meet specific project requirements.\n",
