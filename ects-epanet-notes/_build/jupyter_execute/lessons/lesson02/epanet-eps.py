# # 2.3 Extended period simulation (EPS)
# 
# ## Purpose
# EPS is a representation iused to mimic dynamic behavior in a system.  Not strictly transient, but changes are tracked to approximate filling/draining of tanks and discharge moving along a pump curve.  EPS is also the fundamental concept needed to allow for water quality simulations in EPANET.
