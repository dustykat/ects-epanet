    "## Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Real-time Optimization: Developing efficient algorithms and methodologies for real-time optimization of water distribution networks is an ongoing challenge. This involves dynamically adjusting control settings, such as valve positions and pump speeds, to optimize system performance based on changing demand patterns and operational conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Water Quality Modeling: Enhancing the accuracy and reliability of water quality modeling in hydraulic networks is an active area of research. This includes improving the simulation of chemical reactions, contaminant transport, and disinfection processes to ensure the safety and quality of drinking water.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Resilience and Risk Assessment: Assessing the resilience and vulnerability of water distribution networks to various hazards, such as pipe failures, natural disasters, and deliberate attacks, remains a complex problem. Developing robust methodologies for risk assessment and optimization of network design to enhance system resilience is an ongoing challenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Sensor Placement and Data Assimilation: Optimally placing sensors in the network to gather real-time data and integrating this data into hydraulic models is a challenging task. Efficient techniques for sensor placement and data assimilation can improve system monitoring, leak detection, and fault diagnosis.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Integrated Energy Management: Integrating energy considerations into water distribution network operations is an emerging area of research. Developing optimization algorithms that consider both hydraulic performance and energy efficiency to achieve sustainable operation is an unsolved problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Multi-objective Optimization: Balancing multiple conflicting objectives, such as minimizing energy consumption, reducing water losses, and improving water quality, poses a significant challenge in hydraulic network analysis and operations. Developing efficient algorithms for multi-objective optimization can assist in decision-making for system planning and management.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Uncertainty Analysis: Incorporating uncertainty analysis into hydraulic network models is essential for robust decision-making. Addressing uncertainties related to demand patterns, pipe roughness, parameter estimation, and climate change effects is an ongoing research area.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Smart Water Grids: Exploring the potential of emerging technologies, such as Internet of Things (IoT), data analytics, and artificial intelligence, in optimizing water network operations and management is a frontier of research. Developing smart water grid frameworks and algorithms for automated control and optimization is an unsolved problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Optimal Design and Rehabilitation: Finding optimal designs for new network layouts or rehabilitating existing systems to meet evolving demands is a complex problem. Considering factors such as pipe sizing, network topology, and spatial constraints to achieve cost-effective and efficient designs is an ongoing challenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Interoperability and Data Integration: Integrating data from various sources, such as geographic information systems (GIS), hydraulic models, and operational databases, presents challenges in terms of data compatibility, standardization, and interoperability. Developing frameworks and methodologies for seamless data integration is an area that requires further attention.\n",
    "\n",
    "These unsolved problems highlight the continuous need for research and innovation in hydraulic network analysis and operations. Addressing these challenges can lead to improved efficiency, reliability, and sustainability in the management of water distribution networks.\n",
