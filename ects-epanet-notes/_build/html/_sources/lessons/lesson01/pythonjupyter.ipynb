    "## Python \n",
    "Python is a computer programming language often used to build websites and software, automate tasks, and conduct data analysis. Python is a general-purpose language, meaning it can be used to create a variety of different programs and isn't specialized for any specific problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python is an interpreted language\n",
    "- Compilation steps are not needed; This makes it less cumbersome (e.g class files (i.e. java) are not needed)\n",
    "- Python is less complex than languages such as C++ or Java; Makes it easier to learn and use but there is a tradeoff since programs cannot be as complex\n",

    "\n",
    "The Python interpreter runs the code of a program; in this notebook its part of tha Jupyter kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "A quick way to check is to open a terminal window and type `python --version`.  If the response is somethink like `Python 3.8.3` you have python installed somewhere on your computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "To run a python script interpreter on Windows (other systems are similar) with the path set correctly\n",
    "- Open a command prompt\n",
    "- Type in the command python someFileName.py; This runs the program contained in the file someFileName.py\n",

    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebooks are interactive web-based computational environments that allow users to create and share documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and explanatory text. They support multiple programming languages and are widely used for data analysis, scientific computing, machine learning, and data visualization tasks. Jupyter Notebooks provide an intuitive interface, enabling users to execute code in small, manageable cells and observe the output immediately, fostering an iterative and exploratory approach to programming. Their versatility, ease of use, and ability to blend code with rich media make them a popular choice among researchers, data scientists, and educators for creating reproducible and interactive data-driven workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "This on-line book is created using JupyterBook; when I develop the book i use JupyterHub running on a Raspberry Pi computer\n",

    "### JupyterHub\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Hub is a web-based platform that enables multiple users to access Jupyter Notebooks, an interactive computational environment, simultaneously. It allows users to write and execute code, view visualizations, and create narrative documents that combine code, text, and multimedia content. Jupyter Notebooks support various programming languages, including Python, R, and Julia, making them versatile for data analysis, scientific computing, and machine learning tasks. The Hub provides a centralized server, facilitating collaboration and resource sharing within organizations or educational institutions, making it a powerful tool for data scientists, researchers, and students. Jupyter Hub's flexibility and user-friendly interface have made it a popular choice for collaborative data exploration and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python and Jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "IPython and Jupyter are closely related, and Jupyter Notebooks actually originated as a spin-off of IPython. Here's how they interact:\n",
    "\n",
    "- IPython: IPython (Interactive Python) is an enhanced Python shell that provides a more interactive and powerful environment for working with Python code compared to the standard Python REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop). It offers features such as command history, tab completion, and object introspection. IPython started as a standalone project before it became an integral part of Jupyter.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Jupyter: Jupyter is an open-source project that evolved from IPython. It expanded its support for multiple programming languages beyond just Python, and hence the name change from \"IPython\" to \"Jupyter\" (a combination of Julia, Python, and R). Jupyter allows users to create interactive computational notebooks that combine code, text, images, and other media, making it an ideal platform for data exploration, analysis, and visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Jupyter Notebooks: Jupyter Notebooks are web-based interfaces that allow users to create and share documents containing live code, visualizations, and narrative text. They are built on top of IPython, which serves as the kernel (execution engine) for running Python code within the notebook cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run a Jupyter Notebook, it uses the IPython kernel to execute Python code inside the notebook cells. The notebook interface provides a convenient way to interact with the IPython kernel, allowing you to execute code, view output, and create documentation within the same environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, IPython serves as the kernel that handles the execution of Python code within Jupyter Notebooks, enabling the interactive and rich computational capabilities that Jupyter provides.\n",
