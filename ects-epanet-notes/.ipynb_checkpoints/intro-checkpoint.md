This book and supporting files are located in a public repository on GitHub at [put link here]().  To recreate the book, clone the repository into your /var/www/html directory (or whatever your webroot is). Then create an entry point to `http://YOUR-WEBROOT/ects-epanet/ects-epanet-notes/_build/html/index.html`  and you should have the book. 

:::{note}
Some of the links are to a specific TCP/IP address and you will need to change it to your webroot for the links to work.  If you went to the trouble to clone and rebuild, the prefix (IP address) is obvious; if the address also contains "ects-epanet" then you have the file in the repository and changing the prefix to your webroot will restore the link.
:::

The `freeswmm.ddns.net` is a little more complicated.  Its functionally a Linux instance running on AWS servers, there are ways to transfer and copy instances, but you are probably better served to just buy a suitable computer.
