    "In EPANET we will start the program, build a tank-pipe system and find the head\n",
    "loss in a 10,000 foot length of the pipe. The program will compute the friction factor\n",
    "for us (and we can check on the Moody chart if we wish).\n",
    "\n",
    "The main trick in EPANET is going to be the friction coefficient, in the EPANET\n",
    "manual on page 30 and 31, the author indicates that the program expects a roughness\n",
    "coefficient based on the head loss equation. The units of the roughness coefficient for\n",
    "a steel pipe are $0.15 \\times 10^{-3}$ feet. On page 71 of the user manual the author states\n",
    "that roughness coefficients are in millifeet (millimeters) when the Darcy-Weisbach\n",
